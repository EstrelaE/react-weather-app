## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap

Building this web application to practice my React skills. I had previously built a weather app with Vanilla Javascript and wanted to convert it to React, I thought that this process would be a good way to see the differences between the two, and the benefits of using React - what this library/framework had to offer, improve and simplify. I'm not finished with the app, but so far the process has been smooth and fun, using components and separating functionalities really improves code readability and workflow. 

## Optimizations
*Work in process*

I'm still building this app. These are some of the features I'm still working on:
- A current location button, using GPS location
- A randomizer button, to give the user a random city (just for fun, and a good way to train JavaScript methods)
- Some design details to improve overall look of the app

## Lessons Learned:

Reading documentation is one of the most important and useful ways to learn a new technology and use it properly.
React helps to reduce the chance of bugs, way easier to have a smoother process of building functionalities. Especially when you separate all diferent actions in components.
You shouldn't try to invent the wheel, because it's already done and that would be a waste of time and resources. So, it's good to search good materials/components and use them correctly. But should always pay attention to documentation, if they are maintained or not, and be sure to not use anything you can't understand.
